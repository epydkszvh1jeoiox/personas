                The Roku TV in Caswell's basement, as in many other dorms, is offered for students' use. </br></br>
                <span class="bold-red">I set out to observe and record people using this interface to create a persona and storyboard of a
                college dorm TV user.</span> </br></br>
                This interface has

                <ul>
                    <li>3 HDMI ports for users to use their own input devices</li>
                    <li>Audio in/out ports for headphone use</li>
                    <li>A joystick button that can press in/out, move up/down and move left/right.
                        This controls power, volume, and input selection</li>

                Part 1: <span style="color: #E40044;">Observations</span>
            </div>
            <div id="observations-description">
                I started by observing people using the TV lounge. This TV was used both by individuals and by groups of people. </br></br>

                Each of them had to do some
                <span class="bold-red">"setup,"</span> which included
                <span class="bold-red">(1) turning the TV on and
                (2) choosing an input.</span> </br></br>

                These steps were pretty consistent across different uses, but different groups of people did them in different ways. </br>
                One person was able to navigate the power button behind the TV within a few seconds, but others had different reactions. </br>
                One reaction that I heard a few times was <span class="bold-red">"where is the remote?"</span>
                <div style="text-align: center; margin: 5px;">Spoiler: no one could find the remote.</div>
                One person first felt across the bottom of TV before looking under and then on the side of the TV, where they found the button.</br></br>

                After turning on the TV, users found different ways to use the TV to fit their intended activity.
                Some users had a device (laptop, tablet, phone), an HDMI cord,
                both a cord and a device, or neither with them.</br></br>

                The amount of time it took to insert/change input varied among users, and varied based on what materials
                they brought with them.</br></br>

                <div id="questions">
                    <div class="bold-red">So came my questions for them!</div>
                    <ol>
                        <li>What did you want to use the TV for?</li>
                            <ul class="question-responses">
                                <li>watching movies/TV shows,
                                    screen-sharing presentation with friends,
                                    playing Nintendo Switch games with friends</li>
                            </ul>

                        <li>What was your first-time experience using the TV like?</li>
                            <ul class="question-responses">
                                <li>"Took me a second to find the power and fit my cord into the TV. I can never get the HDMI cord in the slot my first try."</li>
                                <li>"At first I couldn't use it without the remote. The TV has to be on the same Wi-Fi connection as your phone in order to use the
                                    app remote, so I decided to not use the TV. I usually plug in my laptop with an HDMI cord now."</li>
                                <li>"The buttons are kinda weird, I didn't know it changed volume until halfway through a movie.
                                    I still get the power and volume directions mixed up"</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li>What features do you wish the TV had?</li>

                                <li>individual volume buttons, a remote/a way to remotely control without Wi-Fi, louder speakers</li>
